(** CEGARBox SAT-solver.

    We make heavy use of Program Fixpoint/Definition.

    Program Fixpoint allows us to prove that a fixpoint terminates with a custom
    well-founded measurement, and generates obligations to show that every
    recursive call is indeed a strict decrease of the measurement.

    Program also allows us to leave 'holes' in places where propositions are expected.
    We can then fill in these holes as obligations, so that we can actually
    use the proof language rather than trying to do some stuff with function application. *)
